# Discord-Bot

This is a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It involves Python, Discord.py, MySQL, and now the Destiny APIs.<br>  

This bot is also now capable of reading your characters max power and showing what power your max light-level items are at in comparison.  You must allow others to view this information on Bungie.net in order to take advantage of this new functionality.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaelScarfi/Discord-Bot/wiki) for information on .env file and MySQL DB needed to run code.<br/>
