# Discord-Bot

This is a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It involves Python, Discord.py API, and MySQL.  

sundance.py contains the bot code
test.py contains various code snippets for reference and testing

See wiki for information on .env file and MySQL DB needed to run code.
