# Sundance.py

## Welcome to the Sundance GitHub page!
This bot started as a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It has now been expanded to work on any server.<br>  

This bot is also capable of reading your characters max power and showing what power your max light-level items are at in comparison.  It can also recommend pinnacle activities to run to optimize your pinnacle leveling.  You must either allow others to view your inventory on Bungie.net or authenticate with the bot in order to take advantage of this functionality.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaelScarfi/Discord-Bot/wiki) for more information.
