# Discord-Bot

This is a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It involves Python, Discord.py, MySQL, and now the Destiny APIs.<br>  

Coming soon: ~next_level command to show you your characters current level and gear needed for next leve.  Check out the Bungie-APIs branch for the code!

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaelScarfi/Discord-Bot/wiki) for information on .env file and MySQL DB needed to run code.<br/>
