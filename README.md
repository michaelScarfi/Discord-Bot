# Discord-Bot

This is a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It involves Python, Discord.py, MySQL, and now the Destiny APIs.<br>  
I am beggining to work on implementing Destiny APIs into the bot.  My hope is to create some integrations.  Current potential commands in order of least complex to most are:
- next_level: would return gear items needed to reach next power level
- quick_swap: have two items preset to be swapped in your inventory
- loadout_swap: quick swap between two loadouts
<br>

Please feel free to recommend other potentially handy commands.<br>

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaelScarfi/Discord-Bot/wiki) for information on .env file and MySQL DB needed to run code.<br/>
