# Discord-Bot

This is a personal project to create a bot for my Discord Server to organize Destiny 2 raids.  It involves Python, Discord.py, MySQL, and now the Destiny APIs.<br>  
I am beggining to work on implementing Destiny APIs into the bot.  My hope is to create some integrations.  At minimum, I would like to create a command that tells a user their max possible power and the items they need to improve to attain the next power level.
<br>

Please feel free to recommend other potentially handy commands.<br>

See the [wiki](https://github.com/michaelScarfi/Discord-Bot/wiki) for information on .env file and MySQL DB needed to run code.<br/>
